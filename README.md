## What I'm currently working on
### The first version of TractorKit
- The PCBs are ready (and with some errors).
- I'm currently trying to make the code written for the SDL2 lvgl simulator run on a real ESP32 with an attached display.
- Thinking about an automatic discovery system based on mDNS and an API for fetching data from engine sensors and the GPS board over http.
- Designing some 3D printable enclosures.
